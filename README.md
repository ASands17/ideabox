### Introduction

- User can search for ideas that contain a specific word or phrase.
- User can delete idea cards once they are no longer needed.
- Webpage has local storage feature.


### Reflection
- We decided to add features (such as local storage) to the webpage, even though these lessons were not formally taught. This gave us
an opportunity to do our own researching. This will carry over into our careers as software developers as we will often need
to do independent research to find solutions.
- We learned that some functionality was easy to reuse, however other functions were unexpectedly difficult to reuse. It was interesting to see
how the code we wrote in some ways dictated what code we wrote later.
- Teamwork makes the dream work. 


### Future Features
- Allow user to edit ideas once they are submitted.
- Create functionality so that when the user clicks the idea card, they are taken to a new page where they can add additional notes and information about their idea.
